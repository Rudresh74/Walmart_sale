# **Retail Inventory Management and Sales Forecasting**

## **Project Overview**

This project is aimed at optimizing retail inventory management and sales forecasting using a modern data pipeline built on Azure services. The objective is to create a scalable and efficient process that ingests, transforms, and analyzes retail data, providing actionable insights through advanced analytics and reporting.

## **Key Objectives**

- **Optimize Inventory Management**: Reduce stockouts and overstock situations.
- **Enhance Sales Forecasting**: Improve forecast accuracy to align supply with demand.
- **Build a Scalable Data Pipeline**: Efficiently handle large volumes of data.
- **Enable Advanced Analytics**: Support data-driven decision-making through robust analysis.

## **Project Architecture**

1. **Data Ingestion**:
    - **Sales Transactions**: Ingested from on-premises MySQL to Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2.
    - **Inventory Logs & Customer Data**: Sourced from Azure SQL Database and Synapse Warehouse.

2. **Data Transformation**:
    - **Silver to Gold**: Data is transformed in Azure Databricks, calculating key metrics and saving the refined data in ADLS Gen2.
    - **Staging for Snowflake**: The transformed data is moved to a staging area in Azure Blob Storage.

3. **Data Loading**:
    - **Loading to Snowflake**: An Azure Data Factory pipeline loads the staged data into Snowflake, where it's ready for analysis.

4. **Analytics and Reporting**:
    - **Power BI Dashboards**: Data from Snowflake is visualized in Power BI, providing insights into sales trends and inventory levels.

## **Step-by-Step Process**

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Extract and load sales, inventory, and customer data into ADLS Gen2.
  
2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Transform and refine the data in Azure Databricks, saving the output in Blob Storage for staging.

3. **Data Loading**:
   - Use ADF to transfer data from Blob Storage to Snowflake for further analysis.

4. **Validation and Reporting**:
   - Validate data in Snowflake and create Power BI dashboards for reporting.

5. **Automation and Monitoring**:
   - Schedule and monitor the data pipeline for regular updates and smooth operations.

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the development of a data pipeline that enhances retail inventory management and sales forecasting, enabling data-driven insights and decision-making.
